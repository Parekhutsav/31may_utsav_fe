        <h1>Q-5 What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="ans">
        <p>
            Ans: <br>
            <b>[1.] Undeclared variables </b> <br>
            ->An undeclared variable is a variable that has not been declared before it is used in the code. <br>
            ->If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with the return value as “undefined”. <br>
            Ex:- <br>
            console.log(x) <br>
            ->In this example 'x' variable is not defined anywhere. So it is an undeclared variable.  <br><br>
            <b>[2.] undefined variable</b> <br>
            ->It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. <br>
            Ex:- <br>
            var x; <br>
            console.log(x); // Output : "undefined"
        </p>
